# Storage Setup for DummyCorp Bot

Good news! **Netlify Blobs works automatically** - no setup required! ðŸŽ‰

According to the [Netlify Blobs documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/build/data-and-storage/netlify-blobs/):

> "We automatically handle provisioning, configuration, and access control for you. This integrated zero-configuration solution helps you focus on building business value in your project."

## âœ… What This Means

The bot uses `@netlify/blobs` which is **already installed** and works out of the box with Netlify Functions.

**No configuration needed:**
- âœ… No API keys
- âœ… No manual setup
- âœ… No environment variables
- âœ… Just deploy and it works!

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Just use the bot:
1. **Add a user**: `/.netlify/functions/add-user`
2. **Check storage**: `/.netlify/functions/whois`
3. **Use in Slack**: `@Dummy yo`

Data persists across:
- All function calls
- All deployments
- Forever (until you delete it)

## ðŸ“Š For Production

For a real production app with Tipalti, you'd likely use:
- PostgreSQL (Supabase, Neon)
- Redis (Upstash)
- Your existing Tipalti database

But for this demo, Netlify Blobs is perfect and requires zero setup!
